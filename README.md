## **📌 Course Overview**  

Welcome to my **AF3005 – Programming for Finance** repository! This repository contains all the assignments, projects, and code snippets I created during the course. It serves as a portfolio of my work and a reference for future projects.  

Python is widely used in the finance industry for **data analysis, financial modeling, risk management, and automation**. This course introduced me to **Python programming** with a focus on **real-world financial applications**.  

Till now, I learned to:  
✔ Understand **Python fundamentals** relevant to financial applications.    
✔ Implement **financial models and automate tasks**.  
✔ Develop **Python-based financial applications** such as **budget trackers and portfolio management tools**.

## **🎯 My Learnings**  

By the end of this course, I will be able to:  
✅ Understand Python programming fundamentals (variables, data types, operators).  
✅ Apply Python for financial computations (profit/loss, loan amortization, investment modeling).  
✅ Analyze and manipulate financial datasets using Pandas and NumPy.  
✅ Automate financial processes (stock price tracking, risk assessment).  
✅ Develop Python-based financial applications (budget trackers, portfolio management tools).

## **📜 Assignments & Projects**  

Here’s a summary of the assignments and projects I completed during the course:  

1. **📝 Loan Eligibility System**  
   - Built a tool to check loan eligibility based on employment status, income, and credit score.  
   - Used `ipywidgets` for interactive inputs.  

2. **📊 Investment Risk Assessment**  
   - Created a program to classify the risk level of a stock portfolio.  
   - Implemented loops and conditional statements for risk classification.  

3. **💰 Loan Repayment Tracker**  
   - Simulated loan repayment by deducting monthly payments and tracking the remaining balance.  
   - Used a `while` loop to handle the repayment process.  

4. **📈 Stock Price Monitoring**  
   - Developed a tool to track stock prices and trigger alerts when a target price is reached.  
   - Used `continue` and `break` statements to handle missing data and stopping conditions.  

5. **💹 Currency Exchange Tracker**  
   - Simulated daily increases in the exchange rate (PKR/USD) and stopped when the target rate was reached.  
   - Used a `while` loop and `ipywidgets` for interactivity.
